Thank you for downloading my new Mapmodel :)
This Mapmodel shows a very simpel animation. It's my first animation...
Some parts of the Helicopter are not unwrapped right. Sorry, 
but this is my first time I'm using "real" unwraping. 
Check for updates under http://ac-akimbo.net.
Feel free to distribute, change, use and improve my model, 
but please name the autor (dementium4ever)
